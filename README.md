## GMFINITY ASSIGNMENT

## Notes
   1) The deadline was not mentioned earlier ,therefore, I started after receiving a warning email about the assignment being due today. Consequently, I couldn't accomplish much.

   2) Additionally, I included the API URL with the key in the file itself and not in a .env file so that my code could be run simply by downloading it.

   3)Page is live on Githubpages: https://grnn8.github.io/GMFINITY/
